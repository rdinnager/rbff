# rbff

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rbff is to provide an R wrapper around the awesome [boundary-first-flattening](https://geometrycollective.github.io/boundary-first-flattening/) software, which allows you to flatten and / or map a 3d object to a 2d shape (or a sphere).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rdinnager/rbff")
```
## Example

You can flatten a mesh with the `bff_flatten()` function. Using default arguments it tries to find a 2d shape to flatten a 3d mesh into that minimizes angle and area distortion.

```{r example}
library(rbff)

face_flat <- bff_flatten(face)
```

Visualise the area distortion in this flattening:

```{r vis_area, eval=FALSE}
bff_vis_metrics(flat_face, metric = "area distortion")
```

This package is still in the (very) early days of development.
